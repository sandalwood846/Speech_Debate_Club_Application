/*
* Methods: Stripe
* Methods for interacting with the Stripe API. Because we'll interact with the
* Stripe API in a number of different ways, we want to break up the various
* functions into multiple methods. This will allow us to define each function
* once, while reusing them multiple times in our application. Sweet!

// Grab our testSecretKey from /settings.json. Note: we're using our TEST secret
// because we're in TEST mode in the Stripe dashboard (that little LIVE <=> TEST
// toggle at the top left). Note: this is a bit confusing. Toggling this switch
// the first time activates "Live" mode on your account, however, this does NOT
// disable TEST mode. Further, toggling back to TEST once you're in production
// does NOT disable LIVE mode. Rather, each side (LIVE or TEST) shows the data
// generated associated with your test and/or live keys. So, you can still do
// tests locally and see that data in the dashboard before going into production.
